## Overview

The fastest way to get started on Noop is to use one of our pre-configured Templates. Any of the officially supported Templates will automatically create a running Environment with all required Resources (databases, block storage, etc.).

## Creating an Application From a Template

First make sure Noop Desktop is installed.

<Download />

On the home-screen, select the Template for the language and framework you need (If you don't see what you need, [suggest one](https://github.com/orgs/noop-inc/discussions/new?category=feature-requests-and-ideas)). 

Continue to follow the Template-creation process, giving your Application a name and any other necessary configuration.

Workshop will automatically:

- Creating an Environment
- Launching required resources (database, block storage, etc)
- Build the source code
- Deploy the build (locally)
- And finally, create a local endpoint to serve the application from `something.local.noop.app`

## Creating an Application From Scratch

The only thing required to make an app a Noop Application is a `blueprint.yaml` file located in the `.noop` directory in the app root.

See the [Applications docs page](/docs/applications/) for an overview of what Noop Applications are. Also check out the [Blueprint docs page](/docs/blueprints/) for a reference of what a Blueprint can define.

A helpful way to understand how an app is configured to work with Noop is to look at the guides associated with each of the officially supported templates.
