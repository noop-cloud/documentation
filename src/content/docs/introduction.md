Noop is a desktop and web application for running cloud software. To install the desktop app, visit the [installation page](/docs/installation).

Noop runs Applications that include stateless components ([web servers](/docs/services/), [static sites](/docs/statics/) and [chron tasks](/tasks/)), stateful [resources](/docs/resources/) (SQL and noSQL) and object storage (such as S3). Noop handles all aspects of running these apps: security, networking, logging, monitoring, metrics, etc.

We believe local parity of cloud environments is essential to developer productivity. Everything that Noop can run in the cloud is also available in local development (without an internet connection).

By the way, Workshop (the local Noop developer tool), doesn't require a cloud account. Workshop is a great way to experiment and explore how you might want to deploy your application before purchasing cloud infrastructure and subscriptions.

Of course, once you are ready to share your app with the world or want to collaborate with your team, you can deploy it to Noop Cloud. Anything deployed locally will run the same as in the cloud.
