Noop sends the Notification messages to your Email and creates an in-app message in the Engagement Center. Every Notification message will link to the associated failure.

When Notifications are enabled at the Organization level, the Build, Deployment and Pipeline failure messages will be sent for every Application and Environment within that Organization. When Notifications are enabled at the Application level, Build, Deployment and Pipeline failure messages are sent only for those Build, Deployments and Pipelines within that Application.

Notifications are configurable for individual user accounts. For all team members to receive Notifications, each member will configure their Notification separately.
