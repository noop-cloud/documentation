Noop Logs are a noun and represent collections of application output organized by Noop for querying.

log as a verb is not a Noop specific term and therefore not capitalized.

We refer to Noop apps as Applications, we use app as a general term for applications outside of Noop. We try to limit the use of the term Application to avoid confusion, but if it's a Noop Application, "Application" will be capitalized
